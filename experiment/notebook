- dont loose time for transfeffing variable-id between participant and experiment.
- notice that in db, id for each of experimental data follows participant id,

--- that means that each "_id": ObjectID("......<last numbers>") in actual data of last participant will be greater than  "_id": ObjectID("......<last numbers>") of the participant itself.

---- and counting if IDs is 16x system, so: ...86, 87, 88, 89, 8a->participant , 8b, 8c, 8d, 8e->participant, 8e, 8f, 90,  ...

* no need for Start Experiment button

!!! check possibility to use cookie for session, (30 min) and if dies not work, then use raw _id compartion: 

=---write participant and data to one 'session' collection
=---order all data by ObjectID 

=--- when done with all, convert csv: http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm


ps. format jpsych- writing 
=---- is just a modifying LAST query!!!
=---> no  query for getting ID, just MODIFY last PARTICIPANT, adding EXPERIMENT_RESULTS

{

"_id" : ...86,
"age/gender/lang" : ...

"EXPERIMENT_RESULTS" : 
		[
           {
           	"_id" : ...87,
             "rt/answer" : ...
           },
           { 
			"_id" : ...87,
           "rt/answer" : ...
           }
		]
}
