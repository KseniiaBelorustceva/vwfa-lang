  		<p>General background to the project is sources on second <a> language acquisition</a> and researches on <a>visual word form area</a>.</p> 
        
        <h2>Language acquisition</h2>
        <p>Study on word-based perception (Bullard, 1974) showed that acquisition of a second language involves a more word-based approach than that of the first language (experiment used auditory stimuli, and, surprisingly, non-native speakers were better in writing down words heard).</p> 
		<p>Study on acquisition of Russian by children in monolingual (Russian), bilingual (Finnish, Russian) and multilingual (Finnish, Russian, other language) families revealed influence of bilingualism and multilingualism to child education (Protasova, 2000). The effect of language environment learning has been also studied at the example of russian immigrant children in Finland (Oksanen, 2010).</p> 
		<h2>Language environment</h2>
		<p>Evidences from language acquisition suggest that mechanisms, allowing language learning in children, are innate. Mastery of a particular language achieved if learning takes place during period of high neural plasticity (Stromswold, 2000).</p> 
		<h2>Visual vord form area</h2>
		<p>Studies in field of neuroscience reveal that in case of visual word perception intensive responses recorded from a certain brain area, the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). Recent researches showed that response properties of visual word form area are invariant across visual features (i.e. letter case, font, size), but sensitive to orthographic regularity (i.e. pseudowords that looks like normal words produce faster fMRI responses) (McCandliss, 2003).  In addition, researchers evaluated that visual system progressively adapts to certain tasks. </p>

        <h2>Why this project?</h2>
        <p>I am considering this project as the beginning of a future research on cultural and individual differences in multi-language acquisition.
			Main purpose of the project is to learn how to design and analyse psychological experiments. </p> 
		<p>Main objective of this particular experiment is to find out cues to future research by studying visual word perception of Finnish, Russian or English words by 			Finnish, Russian and English native and non-native speakers. </p>
